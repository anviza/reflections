What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I say to computer, that this directory will be repositiory and there is need to track files in it.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is between working repository and working directory. We can better organize commits.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

git diff --staged to compare files in staging area with most recent commit

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

when I need to test new feature or add localisation but don't want this changes in main programm for now.
