When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When several people working on project or I need too "backup" my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because of probable conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks only on GitHub. Clones and Branches both.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

I don't know

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

Email, shared folder, Google Docs. Harder to organise. Easier for novices.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Branches are for testing purposes. So if we don't want to break master, we need to use branches.
